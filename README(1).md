### Project Overview:

This Call Centre Data Analysis Project provides valuable insights into Call Centre operations, encompassing total calls, durations, customer distribution, and key patterns. The analysis explores variations in call volumes across days, channels, sentiments, reasons, and originating states. Understanding these dynamics is essential for optimizing resource allocation, enhancing customer experience, and addressing prevalent service challenges.

---

### Problem Statements:

Efficient call centre management faces challenges, reflected in variable call volumes and negative sentiments.
Billing-related queries stand out as a common reason for calls. Disparities in call distribution among centres signal potential optimization opportunities.
Addressing these issues is crucial for improving service quality, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

DASHBOARD 1: HOME

KPI'S Requirements:

1. Total Number of Calls: We need to track and display the total number of calls received by our call center over a specified period.
2. Total Call Duration in Hours: It is crucial to understand the total amount of time our call center staff spends on calls in hours, which can help us in resource allocation and capacity planning.
3. Total Call Duration in Minutes: Similar to the total call duration in hours, this KPI provides the total call time but in minutes, offering a more granular view of call durations.
4. Average Call Duration in Minutes: To assess the efficiency of our agents, we need to calculate and display the average call duration in minutes. This metric can help identify trends in call handling.
5. Response Time Percentage: Response time is a critical factor in customer satisfaction. This KPI should display the percentage of calls answered within a predefined time frame, helping us gauge our ability to provide prompt service.

Chart's Requirements:

1. Total Call by Day (Column Chart): Display a column chart that shows the total number of calls on each day over a specified time period.
2. Total Calls by State (Filled Map Chart): Create a filled map chart that visualizes the total number of calls received from different states or regions.
3. Top Reason for Calls (TreeMap): Implement a treemap chart to display the top reasons for calls. Each box in the tree map represents a call reason.
4. Total Calls by Channel (Donut Chart): Create a donut chart to showcase the distribution of calls by different communication channels.
5. Total Calls by Sentiment (Column Chart): Utilize a column chart to illustrate the distribution of calls by sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
6. Total Calls by Call Centre (Bar Chart): Create a bar chart that presents the total number of calls handled by each call center or department.

DASHBOARD 1: GRID

Create a Grid View dashboard displaying a table of all call details in Power BI This should allow a user to export the grid for various filters applied

### Project Goal:

The primary goal is to optimize call centre efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Balancing call distribution across days and channels, addressing negative sentiments, and prioritizing solutions for common issues like billing queries are key objectives.
Ensuring a more equitable distribution of calls among call centres aims to enhance overall responsiveness and resource utilization.
The project seeks to address these challenges for improved call centre performance.

### Insights:

#### Call Volume Overview (KPIs):

- Total Calls: 33K
- Total Call Duration: 13.74K hours
- Average Call Duration: 25.02 minutes
- Response Time Percentage: 75%
- Total Customers Engaged: 33K

#### Call Distribution Patterns:

- Days with Highest Call Volume: Thursday and Friday

#### Channel-wise Distribution:

- Call Centre Channel: 11K calls (32%)
- Chatbot: 8K calls (25%)
- Email: 7K calls (22%)
- Web Channel: 7K calls (18%)

#### Sentiment Analysis:

- Negative Sentiment Calls: 11.1K
- Neutral Sentiment Calls: 8.8K
- Very Negative Sentiment Calls: 6K
- Positive Sentiment Calls: 4K
- Very Positive Sentiment Calls: 3.2K

#### Common Reasons for Calls:

- Billing-related Queries emerge as the most common reason for calls.

#### Geographical Call Distribution:

- Highest call volume from Texas (3572 calls)
- Second-highest from California (3631 calls)
- Followed by Florida with 2834 calls

#### Call Centre-wise Performance:

- Los Angeles Call Centre received the majority of calls (14K)
- Baltimore Call Centre ranked second with 11K calls

These insights offer a comprehensive understanding of our call centre operations, highlighting key areas for improvement and optimization. By addressing specific patterns in call distribution, sentiment analysis, and reasons for calls, we aim to enhance customer satisfaction and overall operational efficiency.

---

### Conclusion:

Based on the insights gathered, our call centre operations exhibit a robust performance with a substantial call volume. However, opportunities for improvement lie in addressing prevalent negative sentiments, particularly related to billing queries. The concentration of calls on Thursdays and Fridays suggests potential adjustments in staffing or resource allocation. Moving forward, optimizing response strategies and refining services, especially in high-call-volume regions like Texas and California, will be key to elevating overall call centre efficiency.
